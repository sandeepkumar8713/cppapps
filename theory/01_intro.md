# CPP theory

## C++ core feature vs Standard library vs STL

**Core Feature**
1. Basic building block that makes up c++ programming language.
2. Example : How you **define variables**, Rules that define how you can use a function 
3. It defines the **basic rules** of C++ program. It is the foundation.

**Standard Library**
1. It is ready to use highly specialized components that we can easily use in Cpp program
2. Example : **iostream, string**.
3. We can use it directly without going into details of operation.

**STL**
1. **Standard Template Library** is part of the standard library, but it is a collection of container types.
2. Collection of things, Set of types that allows us to **store collections**, 
   **algorithm or functions** that works on this collection, 
   Specialized types i.e. iterators that allows us to navigate through these containers running these algorithms on
   each element in the collection.
3.
