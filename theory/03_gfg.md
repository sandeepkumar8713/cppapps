## Geeks for Geeks QnA part 2

1. Explain **inheritance**.
The capability or ability of a class to **derive properties and characteristics from another class** is known as inheritance. 
In simple terms, it is a system or technique of **reusing and extending existing** classes without modifying them.

2. When should we use **multiple inheritance**?
Multiple inheritances mean that a derived class can inherit **two or more base/parent classes**. It is useful when a derived class
needs to **combine numerous attributes/contracts and inherit some**, or all, of the implementation from these attributes/contracts.
To take a real-life example consider your Parents where Parent A is your DAD Parent B is your MOM and Chid C is you.

**TODO :: add code example for (multiple inheritance)**
